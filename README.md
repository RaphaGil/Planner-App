# Planner-App

# Console-Finances

## Overview
This project represents a significant milestone in my Front-End Web Developer Bootcamp, constituting the 7th challenge. Throughout this challenge, I've immersed myself in JavaScript fundamentals, gaining hands-on experience in crucial concepts such as working with objects, object methods, handling nested data, iterating through nested structures, utilizing functions and parameters effectively, understanding scope, data storage, and employing jQuery.

## Description
The primary objective of this challenge was to enhance a basic calendar application by leveraging the provided starter code. The task involved enabling users to create and save events for each hour of the day. The resulting application operates within a web browser and exhibits dynamically updated HTML and CSS, all made possible through the utilization of jQuery.
